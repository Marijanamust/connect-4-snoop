[**CHECK OUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE LIVE!**](https://marijanamust.github.io/connect-4-snoop/)

This was the first version of my project in the web development bootcamp, after only two weeks.
The project is still in development and hopefully one day when I stop working on now much bigger projects, I will come back to it and add more functionality.
I found the illustrations online and thought they were absolutely perfect for this little game.
The illustrations come from [a portfolio website](http://mr-birthmark.com/the-evolution-of-snoop-dogg-illustration/) from a very talented artist.
I hope you like it!
P.S. Speakers on for the best experience
